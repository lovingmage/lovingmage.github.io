I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. I currently serve as the co-PI of the NSF Center for Distributed Confidential Computing ([CDCC](https://www.nsf-cdcc.org/)). I am also affiliated with Luddy’s Security & Privacy in Informatics, Computing, and Engineering ([SPICE](https://spice.luddy.indiana.edu/)) Center. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University under the supervision of [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/).

<span style="color:blue"> **I am looking for Ph.D. students and Postdocs to join our team and contribute to research on *ML accelerators and accelerator TEEs*. If you are interested in architecture research and developing new hardware designs, please drop me an email.** </span>

### Research
My current research focuses on trustworthy, data-centric AI infrastructures. Some current research projects are:

- **Private Data systems**
  - [ParsecDB (On-going)](https://github.com/uu60/parsec): A highly efficient, full-fledged secure multi-party database for confidential analytics and ETL pipelines.
  - [DPAR (SC25)](https://sc25.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=pap458&sess=sess296): A drop-in Message Passing Interface (MPI) AllReduce replacement that provides strong privacy with minimal performance cost.
  - [SPECIAL (VLDB24)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3717755.3717764): The first secure workload planner designed for complex analytics over private data federations.
  - [DPidx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21164): The first private learned index for encrypted federations.
  - [Private PoS (Security23)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wang-chenghong#:~:text=Private%20Proof%2Dof%2DStake%20Blockchains%20using%20Differentially%2DPrivate%20Stake%20Distortion,-Authors%3A&text=Abstract%3A,must%20in%20theory%20forgo%20privacy): Use PAC-based learning tools, such as noisy binary trees and Bayesian learners, to quantify privacy leakages in PoS blockchains.

- **Formal methods for data governance**
  - [Picachv (Security25)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chen-haobin): A novel security monitor that formally and automatically enforces data use policies within data analytics and ML data pipelines.
    
- **Confidential accelerators**
  - [BOLT (CCS25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01742): A high-performance, secure, and data-oblivious KVS accelerator (the foundation for secure retrieval-based AI).
  - [LinGCN (NeurIPS23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14331):An accelerator architecture designed to reduce multiplication depth of homomorphic encryption based GCN inference.
  - [AQ2PNN (MICRO23)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613424.3614297): An ultra-fast 2PC-DNN accelerator built on FPGAs.
 

My prior research focuses on the synergy of multi-party comptuation (MPC) and differential privacy (DP) to build practical encrypted databases [SIGMOD20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3318464.3380596), [SIGMOD21](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457306), [SIGMOD22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514221.3526151).


**My research has received generous support from the NSF ([2419821](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2419821&HistoricalAwards=false), [2207231](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2207231&HistoricalAwards=false)), [IU IAS](https://ias.indiana.edu/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html), and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program.html)**
