I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Indiana University. I am also affiliated with Luddy’s Security & Privacy in Informatics, Computing, and Engineering ([SPICE](https://spice.luddy.indiana.edu/)) Center. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University under the supervision of [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/).

<span style="color:blue"> **I am looking for Ph.D. students and Postdocs to join our team. If any of my research topics capture your interest, eel free to reach out via email and include your CV.** </span>

### Research
My research focuses on designing secure-by-design, data-centric AI infrastructures that offer provable security and privacy, enabling a trustworthy foundation for modern AI applications. Some current research projects are:

- **Data infrastructures for trustworthy AI**
  - [ParsecDB (On-going)](https://github.com/uu60/parsec): A highly efficient, full-fledged secure outsourced database that enables critical domain organizations to offload private data to the public cloud for analytics and ML ETL pipelines.
  - [BOLT (On-going)](#): A high-performance, secure, and data-oblivious KVS accelerator (the foundation for secure retrieval-based AI).
  - [Picachv (Security25)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chen-haobin): A novel security monitor that formally and automatically enforces data use policies within data analytics and ML data pipelines.
  - [DPAR (SC25)](#): Private collective-communication AllReduce primitives for HPC-scale ML.
  - [SPECIAL (VLDB24)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3717755.3717764): The first secure workload planner designed for complex analytics over private data federations.

- **Learning-augumented private algorithms**
  - [DPidx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21164): The first private learned index for secure outsourced databases and private data federations.
  - [Security23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wang-chenghong#:~:text=Private%20Proof%2Dof%2DStake%20Blockchains%20using%20Differentially%2DPrivate%20Stake%20Distortion,-Authors%3A&text=Abstract%3A,must%20in%20theory%20forgo%20privacy): Use PAC-based learning tools, such as noisy binary trees and Bayesian learners, to quantify privacy leakages in PoS blockchains.
 
- **Confidential ML accelerators**
  - [LinGCN (NeurIPS23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14331):A framework designed to reduce multiplication depth and optimize the performance of homomorphic encryption based GCN inference.
  - [AQ2PNN (MICRO23)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613424.3614297): A ultra-fast 2PC-DNN accelerators built on FPGAs.
