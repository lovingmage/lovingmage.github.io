Two papers have been accepted recently: 
1. (i) Haobin's paper (with Hongbo, Mingshen, and XiaoFeng) on [formally verified enforcement for data-in-use policies](#) has been accepted by **Usenix Security 25**, congrats! This also marks my first advised student paper at IU.
2. (ii) My paper (with Lina, Johes and Yukui) on [Synopsis Assisted Secure Collaborative Analytics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18388) has been accepted by **VLDB 25**.  Interestingly, as a DB researcher, this is my first VLDB paper—likely because I’ve primarily submitted to SIGMOD in the past.
